I created a mock API to simulate the intended behavior and used local and session storage to ensure data persistence between reloads. I also followed Apple's user experience guidelines to create a smooth and fluid experience for users.-BREAK-Using TypeScript as the main language, I wrote clean and well-organized code and implemented recursive algorithms to iterate through tree data structures. I modified VisJs to visualize these trees in two different ways, and wrote custom SVG code to render the tree nodes. I also developed the app based on provided Sigma designs and created functions to filter sub-trees and render an account balance across different time periods. Overall, my contributions helped to create a functional and user-friendly app for our users.",

I also created several forms with the option to upload images, videos, and files.-BREAK-To enhance the user experience, I implemented polling to check the processing state of uploaded files and created a component that allows users to highlight individual frames of a video. I also built a custom video player and used WavesurferJS to visualize the audio track of an uploaded video. Additionally, I implemented undo and redo functionalities that track the entire modal state.-BREAK-Finally, I created a component that allows users to see how their YouTube thumbnail would look on the YouTube homepage (in both light and dark mode) on different devices (such as a computer, tablet, or mobile phone). I also worked with the YouTube API to provide channel name autocompletion on the edit profile page.",
